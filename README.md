This project demonstrates the creation of a virtual machine (VM) honeypot using Microsoft Azure. The honeypot was designed to capture failed sign-in attempts made to an Azure-based VM, collect the associated IP addresses, and generate an attack map visualizing the geographic locations of these IP addresses.

The primary objective of this project was to monitor unauthorized access attempts, gather threat intelligence, and create a visual representation of attack sources across the globe.
